# Font Practice

This project is a simple webpage designed to help you practice working with different fonts in HTML and CSS.

# Installation
To get started with this project, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You will need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code to view and edit the HTML and CSS files.

# Usage
Once you have the project set up on your local machine, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the webpage. The page includes several sections with different fonts applied, along with some sample text for you to use as a reference.

To practice working with different fonts, try editing the CSS styles for each section to change the font family, size, color, and other properties. You can experiment with different font combinations and see how they look on the page.
